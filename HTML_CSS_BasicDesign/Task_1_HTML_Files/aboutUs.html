			<dt>Who We Are</dt>
				<dd> To say Steaming Mugs purchases and roasts high-quality whole bean coffees is very true. That’s the essence of what we do – but it hardly tells the whole story. Every day, we go to work hoping to do two things: share great coffee with our friends and help make the world a little better. It was true when the first Steaming Mugs opened in 2016 and the trend still continues. The company has multiple stores with the main outlet in Boston's Hungtington Avenue . From just a narrow storefront, Steaming Mugs offered some of the world’s finest fresh-roasted whole bean coffees. The name, inspired by Vipul Krishna who is the chairman of the chain, evoked the romance of the high seas and the seafaring tradition of the early coffee traders.</dd><br>
			<dt>Mission</dt>
				<dd>  To promote humanity, brotherhood and love – one person, one cup, and one neighborhood at a time.</dd><br>
			<dt>Its Not Just Coffee At Steaming Mugs</dt>
				<dd> We’re not just passionate purveyors of coffee, but everything else that goes with a full and rewarding coffeehouse experience. Come over and hang out with your friends and families and we assure you will have a real quality time</dd><br>
